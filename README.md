# PortfolioSite

> Website that keeps my projects (Portfolio)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
* Prefer to start "dev" instead... because i see that my compilation doesn't work with Switch router i've made.
npm run start

```

In near future, i would like to add few things like:
- Media query (to make RWD a little bit better)
- Different - special Mobile look (again, little rebuild)
- Working form to send e-mail direct to my priv one!
- Add more projects (as soon as i'll make some)
- At the end code, cleaning (optimalization)

Thanks for visiting!
